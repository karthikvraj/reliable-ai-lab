**Karthik Coimbatore Varadaraj**

**Reliability engineering for AI systems — before production.**

Reliable AI Lab is an open-source Python toolkit for **LLM evaluation, RAG testing, AI-agent validation, model drift detection, GPU anomaly detection, inference reliability, and deployment guardrails**.

Reliable AI Lab contains thirteen independently runnable projects for testing what happens when AI systems fail: citations become inconsistent, retrieval budgets get tight, agent plans contain unsupported actions, infrastructure loses capacity, telemetry drifts, or deployed data changes.

**No API key or GPU is required for the default demos.**

**Want to try something before installing?** Open the [browser-based AI Failure Lab](https://raw.githack.com/karthikvraj/reliable-ai-lab/main/docs/index.html) and deliberately break a citation, an agent plan, or an inference-capacity assumption.

[Download v0.2.1](../../releases/tag/reliable-ai-lab-v0.2.1) · [Run the Reliability Tour](#run-the-reliability-tour) · [Try the demos](#try-it-in-60-seconds) · [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md)

**Make it yours:** [Fork, change one input, and inspect the result](docs/FORK_AND_RUN.md). Start with a two-claim example and expected outputs.

## Pick a failure

| Failure you want to explore | What the lab deliberately breaks | Start here |
|---|---|---|
| **Grounding failure** | A cited answer changes **60 seconds → 600 seconds**, loses a citation, or reverses a negation | [Evidence Gate](projects/evidence-gate) |
| **Agent-plan failure** | A plan invents a source, requests an unsupported action, and skips human approval | [Repair Agent](projects/repair-agent) |
| **Inference-capacity failure** | A serving pool loses capacity while offered load stays constant | [Inference Twin](projects/inference-twin) |
| **Prompt-boundary failure** | A saved agent trace contains an unauthorized tool call or synthetic marker leak | [Prompt Boundary](projects/prompt-boundary) |
| **Rollout failure** | A canary window regresses against baseline error or latency guardrails | [Rollout Lab](projects/rollout-lab) |

## Run the Reliability Tour

Want the fastest overview? Run three flagship failure scenarios with one command:

```bash
python -m reliable_ai_lab tour
```

The tour runs **grounding**, **agent**, and **AI-infrastructure** examples and returns a compact JSON summary with the observed decision, the failure signal, and what to change next. It uses synthetic fixtures and executes no production actions.

### See a failure before installing

In the [Evidence Gate demo](projects/evidence-gate), a cited source says the cache time to live is **60 seconds**, while the generated claim says **600 seconds**. The tool returns `numeric_review`, points to the source, and lists `600` as an unmatched number. It also flags a missing citation and a reversed negation in the same sample. These are review prompts from lexical checks, not proof that an answer is true or false.

```bash
python -m reliable_ai_lab demo evidence-gate
```

## Why this exists

AI demos often show the happy path. This repository focuses on the failure path.

Use it to explore:

- grounded-answer and citation checks
- retrieval under fixed context budgets
- bounded agent-plan repair
- incident and runbook matching
- inference-capacity failure simulation
- GPU telemetry anomaly detection
- evaluation, calibration and abstention
- reproducible research evidence extraction
- dependency-graph root-cause hypotheses
- statistical and classifier-based drift detection
- preflight checks for proposed infrastructure changes
- prompt-injection outcomes in saved agent traces
- staged rollout guardrails from baseline and canary windows

Each project includes code, tests, synthetic or hand-authored examples, and documented assumptions.

## Try it in 60 seconds

Python 3.10 or later is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karthikvraj/reliable-ai-lab.git
cd reliable-ai-lab
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m reliable_ai_lab demo evidence-gate
```

To launch the local browser playground:

```bash
python -m reliable_ai_lab serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. On Windows, activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate`.

## Build your own reliability test

Reliable AI Lab is designed to be extended, not just read.

**Fork the repository** and contribute one focused improvement:

- add a synthetic failure scenario that exposes a reliability gap;
- implement a metric or detector with explicit assumptions;
- add a framework or local-model adapter without changing the local-first defaults;
- contribute a benchmark case with expected behavior and a regression test; or
- improve documentation around a failure mode you can reproduce.

A strong contribution includes the smallest useful implementation, a test that would fail without the change, and documentation that explains both the result and its limitations.

Start with a [good first issue](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or browse [help wanted](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the fork → branch → test → pull-request workflow.

If you find a case where a check gives the wrong result, a small reproducible counterexample is especially valuable. Please use synthetic, licensed, or otherwise shareable data—not employer, customer, credential, or private material.

## Flagship reliability tracks

**[Evidence Gate](projects/evidence-gate)** checks a claim against its cited text. Change a number in the answer and inspect the flag and source excerpt. It uses lexical checks, not a general fact-checking model.

**[Repair Agent](projects/repair-agent)** checks plan fields, references and allowed actions. It makes bounded repairs and stops when it cannot produce a valid plan. It does not execute the plan.

**[Inference Twin](projects/inference-twin)** simulates a service losing capacity. Compare queue latency before and after server loss, then inspect prediction error on held-out simulated cases.

Together these provide three entry points: **grounding reliability**, **agent reliability**, and **AI infrastructure reliability**. The remaining projects extend those tracks with retrieval budgets, evaluation, drift, change safety, prompt boundaries, root-cause hypotheses, and rollout guardrails.

### Run the three standalone projects

ChangeGuard, Prompt Boundary, and Rollout Lab run directly from Python scripts. They are included in the source bundle and their own ZIPs; the wheel, shared CLI, browser playground, and recorded gallery currently cover the original ten projects.

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 projects/change-guard/change_guard.py projects/change-guard/example.json
python3 projects/prompt-boundary/prompt_boundary.py projects/prompt-boundary/example.json
python3 projects/rollout-lab/rollout_lab.py projects/rollout-lab/example.json
```

Each project README also has commands for running its extracted standalone ZIP.

## Downloads

The [v0.2.1 release](../../releases/tag/reliable-ai-lab-v0.2.1) contains ZIPs for all thirteen projects, the complete lab, a Python wheel and SHA-256 checksums.

[Complete source ZIP](../../releases/download/reliable-ai-lab-v0.2.1/reliable-ai-lab-v0.2.1.zip) · [Recorded demo gallery](../../releases/download/reliable-ai-lab-v0.2.1/reliable-ai-lab-demo-gallery.html)

The HTML gallery shows saved results. It does not run Python. Use the local browser app to compute results from your own inputs.

To build and check the downloads:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m build --wheel
python scripts/package.py
python scripts/check_downloads.py
```

## Run the reproducible benchmark

The first benchmark harness covers deterministic grounding and retrieval regression scenarios:

```bash
python -m reliable_ai_lab benchmark
python -m reliable_ai_lab benchmark --output benchmark-results.json
```

The shipped cases are synthetic regression fixtures, not production performance estimates. See [Benchmarks](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Downstream CI example

The [copyable GitHub Actions example](docs/examples/reliable-ai-lab-downstream-ci.yml) installs the v0.2.1 source tag, runs a deterministic synthetic Evidence Gate check, and uploads its JSON result. Its optional failure step is a project-specific example, not a universal reliability policy.

## Use your own data

```bash
python -m reliable_ai_lab sample gpu-guard --output input.json
python -m reliable_ai_lab run gpu-guard --input input.json --output result.json
```

Only use data you are allowed to share with the local process. Repair Agent also has an optional local Ollama adapter, selected explicitly with `--ollama-model YOUR_INSTALLED_MODEL`. Other projects do not use a model provider.

## Community contributors

Reliable AI Lab welcomes and credits external contributions.

## Scope

This is a research prototype. The included data is synthetic or hand-authored; sample results are not production benchmarks. The default tests do not validate optional Ollama inference. Project READMEs describe the assumptions, methods and known failure cases.

No employer or customer data is included. Earlier facial-emotion work is preserved under [legacy/](legacy/README.md) and is not included in the lab downloads.

If this project is useful, consider starring the repository, sharing a project example, or opening an issue with feedback.
